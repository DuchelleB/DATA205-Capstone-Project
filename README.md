# DATA205-Capstone-Project
This project focuses on analyzing Montgomery County employee salary data from 2019 to 2023, aiming to uncover critical insights into salary growth trends and their alignment with inflation, gender pay gaps and their manifestations across departments, roles, and job grades, and patterns in salary differences across various job sectors. This analysis uses Python as the primary analytical tool, leveraging libraries, such as Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, or SciPy for statistical testing.

The repository is organized into logical sections for clarity and ease of use, namely README.md file, the datasets, the jupyter notebook that contains my project code, the final report, and final presentation of my project.
